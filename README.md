# project_meme
a beginning of a series of games and applications based purely upon the use of memes. 

## Meme.IO:
I am in the process of making another app (repo: project-meme-api) that needs blank memes supplied to it for game sequences.

Since nothing like this exists (to my knowledge) I intend to be the first person to create an API that when called returns a blank meme, without context. 

It should be able to handle things like "type", as well as have middleware to decide when a particular meme is outdated. Eventually, people will post memes to the API for others to use. 

### Short-term Goals: 
ability to pull random blank meme on request. 

### Long-tem Goals:
Self-sufficient meme API. Watch out Zuckerberg.
